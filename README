Provides a simple interface to the open legislation API

Access to legislative data is provided in two central ways: Get and Search. 
Both types of methods return OpenLegislationQuery classes which provide
simple methods for handling complex queries with lazy evaluation. Queries are 
constructed from arguments passed in as well as the current library state.

Get requests should be used when you are looking for a single document of a
single type for which you have unique identification. An example of this 
would be retrieving bill number S66002.

    >>>openleg = OpenLegislation()
    >>>bill = openleg.bill('S66002').fetch()
    
    Get Methods:
        bill(billId)
        meeting(committee,number,session)
        transcript(transcriptNumber)
        
Search requests should be used whenever get requests do not apply. Searches
may be applied across several types. Search terms may by fuzzy [~,*], apply
boolean logic [AND,OR], and support ordering of evaluation [()]. Searches 
can additionally be customized with result ordering (not yet supported).

    Search Methods:
        
        search(searchString,types=[],sponsor=None,committee=None)
        searchFullText(searchString,types=[],sponsor=None,committee=None)
        searchMemo(searchString,types=[],sponsor=None,committee=None)

    Search String:
        
        Search in open legislation supports boolean logic [AND,OR,NOT],
        logical grouping [()], exact matching [""], wildcards [*], and fuzzy
        matching [~]. Example usage and results below:

    Optional Arguments
    
        types: describes the document type for get queries or a list of
        types to include for search queries.
            default: []
            Available types: bill,vote,action,transcript,meeting,calendar
        
        sponsor: restricts result to bills sponsored by the named senator.
            default: None
            Notes: sponsors are identfied by last name.
        
        committee: restricts results to documents having the named committee.
            default: None
                                
Library state is contained in 3 properties: version, and pagesize. 
These properties have default values of '1.0', and 20 by default.
The default values can be overridden in the library constructor or through
direct use of the setPageSize, and setVersion methods.

    Library State Variables:
        
        version: determines the version used in the when building URLs
            Available versions: 1.0
                Only one version has been released, this not yet useful.
        
        mode: determines the format of the returned data when calling fetch
            Available modes html,xml,csv,json,object
                default: json
            
        pagesize: determines the max number of results per page
            Available sizes: natural numbers (integers > 0)
                There is no known maximum size for this value
